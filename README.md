# Mapping Global Gig Economy Index 2020
## Introduction
The debate around the gig economy has been fierce in recent five years especially regarding the labor relation. The definition of employees or workers from traditional labor regulations and employment standards is challenged with the booming of employment in the platform economy. Gig workers, in the most case, are not considered as formal employers which enables flexibility in both sides of employee and employer but in the meantime add vagueness in working regulation, labor rights, and minimum standards and conditions for workers.

This map is part of my project Gigworker and Global Platform Economy. It is designed to visulize the global gig economy index and show the global uneven development of the platform economy. The data used by the map can be found in the the [Report of The Digital Platform Economy Index 2020](https://thegedi.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/DPE-2020-Report-Final.pdf) produced by the Global Entrepreneurship and Development Institute. It provides global data but centers at the Europ and Asia to attract more attention to places other than North America. But the readers can move and see other part of the geographical areas.
